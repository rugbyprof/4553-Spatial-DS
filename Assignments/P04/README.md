## Worldle - Spatial Game Helper Classes
#### Due: 04-26-2022 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.)


### Overview

- Using [Lecture_08](../../Lectures/08_GameHelp) have a "backend" nearly completed to service your game.
- This doesn't mean it has to be a fully functional "api" but it does need to be a set of classes, organized so that you can do the following:
  - Get a country polygon
  - Combine a multi-polygon into a single polygon
  - Load 1-N country polygons into a spatial index (if geopandas works correctly for distance)
  - Calculate the distance between two polygons (if geopandas doesn't work correctly)
  - Reduce the number of points in a polygon 
- Your class(es) should be in the form of a module as shown in [Lecture_07](../../Lectures/07_Folium/)

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `P04` in your `assignments` folder on your repo.
- Add your files that contain your "module" with a number of "tests" written to show the code works. 
- Create a readme in `P04` with a small write up describing your module. 
- Please refer to the [Readmees](../../Resources/02-Readmees/README.md) folder for help on creating a worthwhile readme.
